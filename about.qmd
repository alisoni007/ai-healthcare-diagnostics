This project uses machine learning techniques to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.  
We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze grayscale image data from the SIIM Medical Dataset.  

The final model achieves over 90% accuracy on the test set. This suggests that AI can play a significant role in supporting radiologists in early disease detection, especially in low-resource environments.
